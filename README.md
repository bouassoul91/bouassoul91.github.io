## JS Mario Bros.

This is a *incomplete* recreation of [Nintendo's Super Mario Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros).
This is _not_ a port of the game, this is _not_ code conversion, this is _not_ the ROM running in an emulator. This is
an experimental demo, written from scratch in JavaScript using Phaser.js framework.

This project is in no way endorsed by [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/). Most images, logos, characters, dialog,
plot, and other assets taken from the original Super Mario Bros are copyrights of Nintendo; I claim no ownership of
